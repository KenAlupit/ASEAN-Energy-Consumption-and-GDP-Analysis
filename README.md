# ASEAN-Energy-Consumption-and-GDP-Analysis Program
The ASEAN Energy Consumption and GDP Analysis program is designed to explore the connections between economic output and energy usage within ASEAN countries over a six-year period. The program begins by importing and previewing a comprehensive dataset, then filters the data to include only relevant years and ASEAN member states. It retains key columns related to energy consumption and GDP for analysis.

The core functionality includes a custom plotting function, plot_gdp_regression, which generates scatter plots to visualize the relationship between GDP and selected energy consumption types. This function handles missing data using the SimpleImputer and fits a linear regression model to the data. It plots the regression line and calculates the correlation coefficient, providing insights into the strength and direction of the relationships.

By offering both visual and statistical perspectives, the program aids in understanding how different energy sources impact economic performance across the ASEAN region, making it a valuable tool for researchers and policymakers focusing on energy economics and sustainable development.
